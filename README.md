# Snake Client Project

The goal of this project was to better understand how networking works from the perspective of the client. 

This project covers concepts including:
- callbacks
- asynchronous programming
- importing/exporting modules 
- refactoring code
- working with `stdin`

Completing this project provided me with a better understanding of how TCP networking works.


The server for this project can be found at [snek-multiplayer](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer). You can clone this repository and run the server locally.

The server code for this game was not written from scratch! It is a heavily modified version of the single player game [Snek](https://github.com/taniarascia/snek) created by [Tania Rascia](https://github.com/taniarascia).
